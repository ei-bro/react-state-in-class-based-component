11.1 - Definition of state: what is the difference between state and props?

    - Props (short for "properties")
        - Are external inputs to a React component
        - Used to pass data from a parent component to a child component
        - Immutable within the receiving component
        - Unidirectional flow (parent -> child)

    - State
        - An internal data storage mechanism within a React component
        - It represents the dynamic values that can change over time (event)
        - Used to store and manage data that can be modified within a component
        - When the state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect those changes
